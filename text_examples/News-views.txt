Every child obsessed with dinosaurs knows that these creatures are grouped into the 'bird-hipped' Ornithischia (which includes the herbivorous stegosaurs, ceratopsians and duckbills) and the 'reptile-hipped' Saurischia, which are subdivided into the carnivorous Theropoda (such as Tyrannosaurus rex and birds) and the herbivorous Sauropoda (think Brontosaurus)1. Although this dinosaur family-tree arrangement seems universally acknowledged by everyone from children to wizened palaeontologists, we might all have to rearrange our mental furniture. On page 501, Baron et al.2 present a revolutionary proposal that the relationships of the major groups in the dinosaur evolutionary tree should be radically reorganized.
