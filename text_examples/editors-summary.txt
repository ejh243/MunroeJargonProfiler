For decades, dinosaurs have been divided into two universally accepted groups: the Saurischia, including the carnivorous theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex and the giant sauropods such as Diplodocus, and the Ornithschia, including the ornithopods such as Iguanodon and armored dinosaurs such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus. However, approaches to dinosaur phylogeny may have taken these two groups for granted. A new hypothesis that includes neglected early ornithischians proposes a radical realignment in which sauropods are grouped with the early, carnivorous herrerasaurs, while ornithischians are grouped with theropods. If this new view of the dinosaur evolutionary tree is confirmed, not only will diagrams of dinosaur diversification require an overhaul, but museum displays the world over will have to be rearranged.
